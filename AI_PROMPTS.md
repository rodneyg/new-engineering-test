AI Prompts
This file contains a sample of the key prompts used to build this application.

Read the task, plan out the changes, and suggest 2-3 extra improvements.

Let's build this step-by-step. Start with step 1 of the plan. For each step, give me all the code and the terminal commands to test it locally before we move on.

I'm getting a "failed to send message" error. The terminal log shows a 502 Bad Gateway. What's going on and how do we fix it?

I'm getting a 404 model not found error. Can you write me a python script that uses my API key to list all available models? Give me the command to run it.

Update the code to use this model: models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite

Before we add a big new feature, I want to be able to delete conversations. They're just stacking up. Add a delete button and the backend endpoint for it.

Suggest some high-impact, testable features we could build next. ... Okay, let's implement basic rate limiting for the API.

I don't think the insights dashboard is "actionable" enough. Can we add a new feature that sends all the feedback data to Gemini and asks it to generate a list of actionable insights?

Let's polish the UI. Make the "Generate Insights" button more obvious and improve the formatting of the insights list it returns.

The comment box is confusing. It's not clear when it saves. Can we add an explicit "Submit" button that only appears when you type a comment or change your vote?
